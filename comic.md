**TYPE:** Single Vertical Webtoon Image (Long Strip Format, approx 9:16 aspect ratio).

**INPUT ASSETS & HIERARCHY (STRICT PRIORITY):**
You are provided with three inputs. Blend them strictly according to this rank:

1.  **ABSOLUTE SOURCE OF TRUTH (Attached Video):**
    * **Priority:** HIGHEST (Rank 1).
    * **Usage:** MASTER REFERENCE for IDENTITY & ANATOMY.
    * **TECHNIQUE: VIRTUAL ROTOSCOPING.**
        * *Instruction:* Do not "draw" the character from imagination. Imagine you are **TRACING** over the video frame.
        * *Geometry Lock:* You must strictly preserve the **Video's facial landmarks**: the exact distance between eyes, the width of the nose bridge, and the curve of the jaw.
        * *Override:* If the "Webtoon Style" tries to make the nose smaller or the chin sharper, **STOP**. Keep the Video's proportions, even if it looks less "anime".

2.  **STYLE & CONSISTENCY GUIDE (Attached Character Sheet):**
    * **Priority:** HIGH (Rank 2).
    * **Usage:** OUTFIT & RENDERING STYLE.
    * *Command:* "Apply the line art and shading style of this sheet, but apply it onto the **TRACED GEOMETRY** from the video."

3.  **NARRATIVE INSTRUCTION (Attached Script):**
    * **Priority:** MEDIUM (Rank 3).
    * **Usage:** POSE, ACTION, BACKGROUND.
    * *Constraint:* Do NOT let the script override the character's facial structure.

**DEMOGRAPHIC & ID PRESERVATION:**
* **NO GENERIC ANIME FACE:**
    * *Forbidden:* Generic V-line chins, tiny noses, huge eyes (unless subject has them).
    * *Required:* If the subject has a wide face, draw a wide face. If they have a hooked nose, draw a hooked nose.
* **DISTANCE ANCHOR (CRITICAL):** Even in wide shots or distant panels, you MUST render the face with recognizable features. Do not use "dot eyes" or blank faces. If the face is too small, zoom in slightly or increase facial detail density.

**MICRO-DETAILS ENFORCEMENT:**
* **Imperfections are Identity:** Include specific markers from the video (moles, eyebags, scars, hairline shape). These are not defects; they are the character's ID.

**CONTINUITY & RENDERING SPECS:**
* **Model Lock:** Treat the inputs as a "3D Model". Simply "pose" that model.
* **Outfit Consistency:** The outfit defined in the inputs is immutable.
* **Line Art:** **G-Pen Style** (Crisp, medium thickness).
* **Shading:** **Hard Cel-Shading** (Sharp shadows).

**ART STYLE & ATMOSPHERE:**
* **Style:** Match the exact style of the Attached Character Sheet (High-fidelity Webtoon/Manhwa).
* **Color Palette:** Sample base colors from the Video, but **boost Saturation and Vibrance by 15-20%**. Transform dull video lighting into cinematic Webtoon colors.

**STRUCTURAL EXECUTION (FROM SCRIPT):**
* **Layout:** Strictly follow the panel arrangement defined by the `[Layout: ...]` tags.
* **Text & Balloons:** Place SPANISH text exactly as written into the appropriate balloon types.

**CONTENT SCRIPT TO VISUALIZE:**
(Render the following sequence using "Virtual Rotoscoping" logic on the Video for the face, and Character Sheet for the style):
